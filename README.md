## üöÄ Key Features  

- **PDF Document Processing**: Load and preprocess PDF documents.  
- **Text Chunking**: Split text into manageable chunks for processing.  
- **Embedding Generation**: Use vector embeddings for semantic search and analysis.  
- **Query Handling**: Retrieve relevant information and generate responses based on document content.  
- **Lightweight Model Integration**: Incorporate GPT-2 for fast and efficient responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps  

1. **Load Documents**: Import and parse PDFs for text extraction.  
2. **Chunk Text**: Divide large documents into smaller sections for better manageability.  
3. **Generate Embeddings**: Convert text chunks into embeddings for efficient similarity search.  
4. **Perform Query and Search**: Retrieve relevant chunks based on user queries.  
5. **Generate Responses**: Use GPT-2 to provide detailed and insightful answers.
